# Call for Papers 

&nbsp;  

The emergence of new digital technologies boosted by several software-based technological advancements, such as deep learning, Internet of Things (IoT), and distributed ledgers brought profound modifications to society regarding not only economical but also social and psychological aspects. This process of changing established patterns in the economy and society through digital transformation and related innovations has been called digitization. Software-intensive businesses are not only affected by but often drive digitization. The 6th International Workshop on Software-intensive Business (IWSiB) aims to bring together different research communities working on topics relevant to software-intensive business, to jointly investigate these challenges, and to bridge the gap between different research communities. The workshop is expected to spread knowledge through vivid discussions about contemporary issues and exchange information and experiences. As such, the workshop seeks to improve research contributions through swift feedback from the community, and to develop new projects between researchers and practitioners. To this end, the workshop will be a mix of research work, interactive discussions and group activities, to maximize the potential synergy among the participants from different research fields and industry.

## Submission Guidelines & Themes

IWSiB seeks submissions describing novel research and emerging ideas. We are interested in studies describing original and unpublished results in the field of software-intensive business. The focus of the workshop is on new promising ideas and therefore work-in-progress reports are welcome to ignite discussion in the workshop. The paper length should not exceed 8 pages.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited, to the following aspects of software-intensive business:

- **Software product management** (e.g., strategy, planning, pricing)
- **Software ecosystem** (e.g., engineering ecosystems, analysis of - ecosystem data, modeling of ecosystem structure and behavior, management of developer ecosystems and platforms)
- **Continuous practices** (e.g., experimentation, innovation, improvement)
- **Agile & lean projects & portfolio** (e.g., methods & practices, management and organizing, behavioral and cognitive factors)
- **Organizational management** (e.g., managing technical and social debt, integrating product and business development)
- **Software startups** (e.g., scaling, pivoting, business models)
- **Software platform** (e.g., orchestration, governance, architecture, evolution and lifecycle)
- **Software engineering economics** (e.g., in engineering of software or in the software industry)
- **Emerging trends and research areas** (e.g., remote work, deep learning, AI ethics, digital twins, management of human-AI symbiosis, etc.)

## Guidelines ##

All submissions must conform to the LNBIP formatting and submission instructions. Authors should consult Springerâ€™s author guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form.

The paper length should not exceed **8 pages**.

There is no limit on the number of submissions an author may submit, but authors are advised to focus on quality rather than on quantity.

By submitting to IWSiB , authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree that papers submitted to IWSiB must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere while under consideration for IWSiB.

Papers must be submitted electronically via XP 2023's EasyChair by the defined deadline (see above) selecting the IWSiB 2023 track on the link: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=xp2023](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=xp2023)
